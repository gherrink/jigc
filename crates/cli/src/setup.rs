//! `jigc setup` — the adapter install handler.
//!
//! Orchestrates the two MVP adapter injections (`design/assistant-adapter.md` →
//! The three responsibilities, items 1 + 2) against the located repo root, using
//! the embedded Claude Code profile:
//!   1. inject the marker-fenced bootstrap **line** into `CLAUDE.md` (the
//!      universal floor);
//!   2. merge the `jigc *` **allowlist** into `.claude/settings.json` (the
//!      path-of-least-resistance the bootstrap depends on).
//!
//! `jigc setup` is the install the unset-project orientation routes the agent to
//! (`crate::orient` → `OrientationView::unset_project`; `design/bootstrap.md` →
//! Orientation output examples). The hook + spawn binding are post-MVP and out of
//! scope here — MVP adapter scope is the static-line floor + the allowlist only.
//!
//! Outcome is reported through the settled **finding** envelope (`DECISIONS.md`
//! 2026-05-31 → block-payload = a blocking-severity finding carrying a route):
//! success yields a plain summary; a write failure yields a single blocking
//! `setup.*` finding whose `route` directs the human's next action, and the
//! dispatcher maps it to a non-zero exit.
