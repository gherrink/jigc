//! The validation engine — read-only probes over a scope, severity via cascade,
//! the `finalize` gate.
//!
//! See `design/validation.md`. MVP engine-native probes: `workflow-refs`,
//! `file-state`, plus the synthetic `schema-conformance` integrity checks.
//!
//! ## `schema-conformance` (synthetic category)
//!
//! `schema-conformance` is a **synthetic** validate category (`validation.md` →
//! Synthetic categories): not a literal `check(target, ctx)` probe, but a namespace
//! for schema-driven integrity checks the engine runs over an already-parsed
//! instance. Inc-4 ships three of the four (`DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-31 → inc-4
//! planning pins → schema-conformance scope); **`ref-resolves` (forward-ref / edge
//! index) is explicitly inc-5** and is *not* run here.
//!
//! - **`required-slot-present`** — every declared body slot must hold non-empty
//!   prose. The parser already requires the section *heading* (a missing heading is
//!   a `conformance.section-missing` parse error), so this check fires on the
//!   present-but-empty slot: the LLM left it unfilled. (`finalize.md` → phase 2:
//!   "validate blocks on required-slot presence".)
//! - **`required-field-present`** — every **author-required** declared field must be
//!   present in the instance. A field is author-required iff it carries neither a
//!   `default:` nor a `set:` — those are CLI-derived / defaulted, never the author's
//!   obligation. (`document-type-schema.md` → Field provenance.)
//! - **`field-value-conformant`** — every present field's value must pass its
//!   declared type, reusing [`crate::write::check_value`] (the same write-time
//!   adjudicator). A malformed date / non-member enum / empty string blocks.
//!
//! Each violation is one intrinsic **blocking** `schema-conformance.*` [`Finding`]
//! (the inventory default severity; cascade tuning is not wired into engine probes
//! yet, paralleling `workflow-refs` / `file-state`). A fully-conformant instance
//! yields none.
